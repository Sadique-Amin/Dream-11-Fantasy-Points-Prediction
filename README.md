🔍 Project Overview
This project predicts fantasy points for IPL matches using historical player statistics, match dynamics, and pitch conditions. It combines the strengths of ensemble learning, NLP, and Monte Carlo simulations to create a reliable match-day forecasting engine. The project is designed with MLOps best practices for automation, reproducibility, and scalability.

📦 Features
🏏 Predicts individual player performance & total fantasy score

⚙️ Fully automated ML pipeline with one command execution

🤖 Quantile Regression + Monte Carlo Simulation for uncertainty modeling

🗣️ NLP classification of pitch commentary using DistilBERT

📦 Delivered in a Docker container for easy deployment

🔄 Reproducible outputs, no need to retrain on every match

📊 Data Collection & Preprocessing
Sources:

Player stats: ESPNcricinfo's Statsguru, Cricbuzz

Ground info: Manually compiled

Match history: Unique match records across careers

Pitch reports: Scraped from Sportskeeda and other sources

Preprocessing Highlights:

✅ Normalized team name variations (e.g., Delhi Daredevils → Delhi Capitals)

✅ Deduplicated match records to avoid overlapping stats

✅ Separated batting and bowling stats for clarity

✅ Added rolling statistics for form (last 5 matches)

📈 Models Used
🎯 Final Model:
Quantile Regression + Monte Carlo Simulation

Models uncertainty with predicted means and standard deviations

Assumes normal distribution for simplicity and interpretability

🧠 NLP Classifier:
DistilBERT fine-tuned to classify pitch reports into:

Batting-friendly

Bowling-friendly

🧪 Other Models Explored:
XGBoost Classifier & Regressor with engineered features

KDE-based probabilistic models (discarded due to poor fit)

⚙️ Usage Guide
Input:

Match number

Playing 22 (including impact subs)

Output:

Predicted fantasy points

Recommended team

Steps:

Fetch the upcoming match schedule

Input match number via Docker CLI

Automatically fetch toss and team info

Run data preprocessing and feature generation

Model predicts performance → Monte Carlo simulates outcome

Suggests optimal fantasy team (>850 points expected)

🧠 Team Insights
This project reflects a blend of domain knowledge, model experimentation, and engineering practicality. The use of NLP to quantify pitch commentary and the adoption of quantile-based uncertainty models make this a comprehensive MLOps case study in sports analytics.
